# Clippy Configuration for Trust Financial Trading Application
# 
# These settings enforce extremely high code quality standards
# appropriate for financial applications where bugs can be catastrophic.
# 
# Complexity thresholds are set to encourage readable, maintainable code
# while allowing justified exceptions for complex financial calculations.

# === COMPLEXITY THRESHOLDS ===
# 
# Cognitive complexity measures how difficult code is to understand
# Financial trading logic can be inherently complex, but should be decomposed
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 15

# Note: Cyclomatic complexity is now handled by cognitive complexity threshold
# which provides better measurement of code comprehension difficulty

# Function length threshold encourages decomposition of large functions
# Shorter functions are easier to test, debug, and maintain
too-many-lines-threshold = 75

# Type complexity threshold prevents overly complex type definitions
# Important for financial data structures that must remain comprehensible
type-complexity-threshold = 250

# === FINANCIAL DOMAIN SETTINGS ===
#
# These settings are specifically tuned for financial applications
# where precision, safety, and auditability are critical

# Allow breaking exported API for financial safety improvements
# When financial accuracy requires API changes, safety takes precedence
avoid-breaking-exported-api = false

# Minimum Supported Rust Version - matches project requirement
# Ensures clippy suggestions are compatible with our toolchain
msrv = "1.93.0"

# === PERFORMANCE SETTINGS ===
#
# Optimize clippy for development workflow performance

# Performance settings are handled via clippy command-line flags
# rather than configuration file options

# === DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS ===
#
# Financial applications require comprehensive documentation

# Documentation enforcement is handled via #![warn(missing_docs)]
# in crate roots rather than clippy configuration

# === STRICTNESS LEVELS ===
#
# These will be enforced via #![deny(...)] attributes in crate roots
# during Phase 2 implementation. Configuration here provides baseline.

# Allow certain lints that will be explicitly denied in code:
# - unwrap_used: Will be denied to force proper error handling
# - expect_used: Will be denied to force proper error handling  
# - indexing_slicing: Will be denied to prevent panics
# - panic: Will be denied completely
# - float_arithmetic: Will be denied for financial precision
# - integer_arithmetic: Will be denied for overflow safety
# - cast_precision_loss: Will be denied for financial accuracy
# - cast_possible_truncation: Will be denied for data safety
# - cast_sign_loss: Will be denied for correctness

# These lints will be managed via source code attributes for better
# visibility and explicit exception handling in financial calculations.
